Reflections
This assignment was good to help walk myself thought the steps we covered in class. 
It was super helpful to actually work on what we saw and made everything clearer. 
Although the git push still confuses me and I think it might be helpful to cover that again. 
As far as my team goes, Josh and I were able to get everything figured out and help each other to figure things out when we struggled. 
I look forward to getting more comfortable with this sort of content!
